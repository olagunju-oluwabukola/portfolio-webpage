        <h1>About Me</h1>
    </span>
<div class="about-content">
    <p>I am a dedicated and accomplished professional with a passion for electrical engineering and a proven track record in the field of MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing) design. Holding a degree in Electrical Engineering, I have honed my skills through a combination of academic excellence and practical experience. My commitment to excellence is underscored by my recognition as an award winner in a prestigious MEP design competition, showcasing my innovative approach and problem-solving capabilities.</p>
    <br> <p>One of my key strengths lies in my proficiency with AutoCAD MEP, a software essential for efficient design and drafting in the realm of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems. I have successfully translated conceptual ideas into detailed and accurate technical drawings, ensuring the seamless execution of projects. This hands-on experience has not only enhanced my technical expertise but has also equipped me with a keen understanding of the intricacies involved in MEP design and project engineering.</p>
     <br><p>In addition to my proficiency in AutoCAD MEP, I possess a specialized knowledge in renewable energy systems. Recognizing the growing importance of sustainable practices in engineering, I have actively engaged in projects that harness renewable energy sources to create efficient and eco-friendly solutions. My commitment to sustainable engineering extends beyond theory, as I have successfully delivered projects that integrate renewable energy technologies into traditional systems, showcasing my ability to blend innovation with practical application.</p>
    <br> <p>Furthermore, I specialize in Extra Low Voltage (ELV) services installation, an area critical for modern infrastructure. This encompasses the installation and maintenance of systems such as fire alarms, security systems, and communication networks. My proficiency in ELV services ensures that I can contribute to the creation of comprehensive and secure built environments.</p>
    <br> <p>To complement my hands-on experience, I have cultivated a proficiency in a selection of engineering software, enhancing my adaptability and versatility in tackling various aspects of engineering projects. This breadth of knowledge allows me to navigate complex engineering scenarios with ease, ensuring that each project is executed with the highest degree of professionalism and efficiency.</p>
    <br> <p>In summary, my background in electrical engineering, coupled with my accolades in MEP design and hands-on experience in AutoCAD MEP, renewable energy, project engineering, ELV services installation, and proficiency in engineering software, defines me as a dynamic professional ready to contribute to innovative and sustainable engineering solutions.</p>
