        <p>
            As the M&E Engineer for a banking system building project, I oversaw the implementation of specialized mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems to ensure seamless operations and security. This included HVAC, electrical distribution, fire protection, plumbing, and data communication systems tailored to banking needs. Challenges like regulatory compliance and security standards were addressed through collaboration with stakeholders. Quality assurance measures ensured reliability and compliance. The project delivers a secure, efficient, and technologically advanced environment for banking operations.
